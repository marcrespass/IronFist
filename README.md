# IronFist

This simple iOS app for me to learn SwiftUI and have an app to help me do the rice bucket grip strengthening exercise.
It is based on the shell script posted on Reddit /r/climbing

The thread links to this page (only accessible via web.archive.org) from a rock climbing article about the rice bucket exercise.
